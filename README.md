## Part 1: Data

The BRFSS data set represents the data collected by calling people either at landline or cellular phones. People were selected randomly and not assigned. We deal with a retrospective observational study with random sampling and with no random assignment here. Which means that we cannot make causal conclusions based on this data. However, we can use this data for making correlation statements, and the results of our findings can be generalized to the whole population of people who has either landline or cellular phone and is older than 18 years.

## Part 2: Research questions

**Research question 1:**

### Do people in coastal states have better health than those in landlocked states?

According to Wikipedia, there are 25 states and territories of the USA that have a coastal line, and the rest 28 including the District of Columbia are 'landlocked'. So, the states are almost equally divided which makes it interesting to compare. My personal belief is that proximity to the ocean makes people happier but happiness is something hard to evaluate, so we'll be focusing on people's health instead.

**Research question 2:**

### Do you drink more soda than your grandpa?

We often blame the younger generation for not sticking to a healthier lifestyle. But do the youngsters really as bad as older folks think? Let's find out whether consuming soda and pop has anything to do with the age.

**Research question 3:**

### Does a smoker have a higher chance to live alone?

That would be fun to know if there's an association between living alone and smoking. If there's an association, would that mean that smoking leads you to live alone or vice versa? Not really. Association doesn't mean causation. For the sake of this test, I suspect that being a smoker (explanatory variable) might affect your tendency of being the only person in your household or living with somebody (response variable).
